                    Modern residential complexes are a tasty target for
                    intruders. The presence of new facilities, parking lots,
                    elevator equipment, and other costly infrastructure can
                    become the object of encroachment. To make your complex safe
                    and comfortable, you can't do without professionals.
                    <b>AGOS</b> is committed to providing the best security
                    service thanks to its know-how in the field of security
                    management of residential complexes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>AGOS</b> takes into consideration the peculiarity of
                    security and protection within a residential complex since
                    the contract is usually concluded with a legal entity
                    (condominium corporation), but in fact, each owner of the
                    apartment is also a full participant in the transaction and
                    has the right and opportunity to influence the process of
                    organizing security measures and his expectations must be
                    met.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main task is to ensure maximum security for owners,
                    tenants, and their property, as well as the creation of a
                    friendly and supportive environment so that people feel
                    comfortable. In order to achieve this, the security guards
                    of our company <b>AGOS</b> rigorously watch over :
                </p>
                <p>- Monitoring the entrances and exits of the main doors.</p>
                <p>
                    - Checking the general condition of the buildings and the
                    functioning of their equipment.
                </p>
                <p>- Alert and intervene in case of fire.</p>
                <p>- Collecting residents' complaints.</p>
                <p>
                    - Writing reports in case of incidents or general
                    dysfunction.
